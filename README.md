## Abstract
The goal of this work is to construct a context-free grammar to parse a given set of sentences. However, a frequent result of the CFG formalism is that the grammar overgenerates and ungrammatical sentences are allowed. This is mitigated by adding grammar unification. We account for verb frames i.e. what structures follow a verb and the correct use of person, number and the verb form.

## Code
To run the code follow these instructions.
- Please note that the code is implemented using Python 3.
- Virtual environment is enclosed for convenience and can be activated by running 'source ve/bin/activate'
- Script with the required functionality can be executed by command 'python3 script.py'

## Note
See report.pdf for more information, analysis and conclusions.
